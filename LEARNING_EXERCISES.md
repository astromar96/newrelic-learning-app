## üéØ Exercise 1: Baseline Performance Monitoring

**Goal**: Understand normal application behavior

**Steps**:
1. Start the application
2. Click "Get Users" button 10 times
3. In New Relic, go to **APM** ‚Üí **Transactions**
4. Find the `/api/users` transaction
5. Note the average response time

## üß† Exercise 6: Memory Monitoring

**Goal**: Track memory usage patterns

**Steps**:
1. Go to **APM** ‚Üí **Summary** and note current memory usage
2. Click "Memory Intensive" button 5 times
3. Wait a minute and refresh
4. Observe memory changes

**What to observe**:
- Memory usage spikes
- Garbage collection patterns

## üìä Exercise 7: Creating a Custom Dashboard

**Goal**: Build a useful monitoring dashboard

**Steps**:
1. Go to **Dashboards** ‚Üí **Create a dashboard**
2. Add these widgets:
   - Response time chart (line chart)
   - Error rate (billboard)
   - Throughput (area chart)
   - Slowest transactions (table)
3. Arrange them in a useful layout
4. Save your dashboard

**NRQL queries to use**:

```sql
-- Response Time
SELECT average(duration) 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE appName = 'NewRelic Learning App' 
TIMESERIES

-- Error Rate
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error IS true) 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE appName = 'NewRelic Learning App'

-- Throughput
SELECT rate(count(*), 1 minute) 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE appName = 'NewRelic Learning App' 
TIMESERIES

-- Slowest Transactions
SELECT average(duration) as 'Avg Time', 
       count(*) as 'Count' 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE appName = 'NewRelic Learning App' 
FACET name
```

---

## üö® Exercise 8: Alert Conditions

**Goal**: Set up effective alerting

**Create these alert conditions**:

1. **High Response Time Alert**
   - Condition: Transaction duration > 2 seconds
   - For at least: 5 minutes
   - Action: Send email

2. **Error Rate Alert**
   - Condition: Error rate > 5%
   - For at least: 3 minutes
   - Action: Send email

3. **Throughput Drop Alert**
   - Condition: Request rate drops > 50%
   - For at least: 5 minutes
   - Action: Send email

**Test your alerts**:
- Use the app buttons to trigger conditions
- Verify you receive notifications
- Practice acknowledging alerts

**Try these queries**:

```sql
-- 1. All transactions grouped by name with percentiles
SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 95, 99) 
FROM Transaction 
FACET name 
SINCE 1 hour ago

-- 2. Error rate by transaction
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error IS true) 
FROM Transaction 
FACET name 
SINCE 1 hour ago

-- 3. Compare this hour to last hour
SELECT average(duration) 
FROM Transaction 
FACET name 
SINCE 1 hour ago 
COMPARE WITH 1 hour ago

-- 4. Requests by HTTP method
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Transaction 
FACET request.method 
SINCE 1 hour ago

-- 5. Slowest individual transactions
SELECT max(duration), timestamp 
FROM Transaction 
FACET name 
SINCE 1 hour ago

-- 6. Custom attributes
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE customerId IS NOT NULL 
FACET planType 
SINCE 1 hour ago
```

**Challenge**:

## üéÆ Exercise 10: Load Testing

**Goal**: See how your app performs under load

**Steps**:
1. Open the app in multiple browser tabs (3-5 tabs)
2. In each tab, rapidly click different buttons
3. Generate diverse traffic patterns
4. Monitor in New Relic real-time

**What to observe**:
- How does throughput increase?
- Do response times degrade?
- Any memory issues?
- Error rate changes?

**Advanced challenge**:
- Use a tool like `Apache Bench` or `wrk` to generate real load:
  ```bash
  # Install Apache Bench (if not installed)
  # On Mac: brew install httpd
  
  # Generate 1000 requests with 10 concurrent connections
  ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:5000/api/users
  ```
